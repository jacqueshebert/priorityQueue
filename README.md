# priorityQueue
This project simulates a hospital waiting room for women delivering babies and prioritizes them based on their time until labor and operation time. The FinalProject.cpp runs a timed enqueue and dequeue test between the binary heap (QueueBH), linked list (QueueLL), and the standard template library (Compare.h) implementation. The test results and more specific details can be found in the writeup.pdf.
This project was designed to run with g++ -std=c++11 with all the .cpp file names and the patientData.csv as a commandline argument.
